# SpinCycle: Slot Machine Game Project Context

## 🎯 Project Overview

**SpinCycle** is a minimal slot machine demo app built with modern web technologies. This is a technical showcase for web game development with clean animations, reusable logic, and minimalistic design.

### Key Technologies
- **Frontend Framework**: Svelte 5 + TypeScript
- **Animation Library**: GSAP (for smooth reel spinning)
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit tests) + Playwright (E2E tests)
- **Styling**: CSS + TailwindCSS 4.0
- **Build Tool**: Vite 6.0
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Patterns

### Core Architecture
The project uses a clean, component-based architecture with centralized state management:

1. **Game Store** (`gameStore.ts`) - Central state management using Svelte stores
2. **Game Loop** (`gameLoop.ts`) - Animation coordination and timing
3. **Components** - Reusable UI components for slot machine elements
4. **Configuration** - Centralized game settings and symbol definitions

### Key Innovation: Array-Based Solution
The project went through a major architectural evolution to solve state synchronization issues. The breakthrough was switching to an **array-based approach** for reel management:

- **Pre-allocated Arrays**: 100 sets of symbols (2000 total) per reel to enable infinite scroll
- **Index-Based Position Tracking**: Uses modulo arithmetic for seamless looping
- **Performance Optimization**: No DOM re-renders during animation, only index updates
- **Debug-Friendly**: Easy visualization of array positions and states

## 🎮 Game Features

### Core Functionality
- **3-Reel Slot Machine**: Classic slot machine layout with 4 visible symbols per reel
- **Smooth Animations**: GSAP-powered reel spinning with cascading delays
- **Multiple Pay Lines**: 5 pay lines with different multipliers
- **Bet Management**: Adjustable bet amounts (1-100 credits)
- **Balance Tracking**: Real-time balance updates and win calculations
- **Win Detection**: Comprehensive win calculation across pay lines

### Symbols & Values
```typescript
SYMBOLS = [
  { id: 'seven', name: 'Seven', value: 100, emoji: '7️⃣' },
  { id: 'bell', name: 'Bell', value: 50, emoji: '🔔' },
  { id: 'cherry', name: 'Cherry', value: 25, emoji: '🍒' },
  { id: 'lemon', name: 'Lemon', value: 15, emoji: '🍋' },
  { id: 'orange', name: 'Orange', value: 10, emoji: '🍊' },
  { id: 'plum', name: 'Plum', value: 5, emoji: '🫐' }
]
```

### Pay Lines Configuration
- 3 Horizontal lines (top, middle, bottom) - 1x multiplier
- 2 Diagonal lines (left-to-right, right-to-left) - 2x multiplier

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### State Management Pattern
- **Svelte Stores**: Reactive state management with writable/derived stores
- **Callback Props**: Components communicate via callback function props (Svelte 5 pattern)
- **Single Source of Truth**: Game state centralized in `gameStore.ts`

### Animation System
- **GSAP Integration**: High-performance animations with timeline control
- **Infinite Scroll**: Pre-allocated arrays prevent DOM manipulation during animation
- **Independent Reels**: Each reel manages its own animation state with coordinated timing
- **Cascading Delays**: Realistic slot machine behavior with staggered reel stops

### Performance Optimizations
- **Pre-allocation Strategy**: 100 symbol sets prevent runtime memory allocation
- **Index Tracking**: O(1) position calculations using modulo arithmetic
- **Minimal Re-renders**: Event-driven updates only when necessary
- **Memory Efficiency**: Reusable symbol objects across reels

### Debug System
The project includes a sophisticated debug overlay:
- **Real-time Array Visualization**: Shows current array indices overlaid on reels
- **State Monitoring**: Tracks spin counts, positions, and reel states
- **Non-blocking Interface**: Debug overlay doesn't interfere with gameplay
- **Responsive Design**: Works across all screen sizes

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing (Vitest)
- **Game Store Tests**: Validates state transitions and win calculations
- **Component Tests**: Tests individual component behavior
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage ensures type correctness

### E2E Testing (Playwright)
- **User Flow Testing**: Complete game interactions from bet adjustment to winning
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Ensures compatibility across different browsers
- **Visual Regression**: Validates UI consistency

## 🚀 Problem-Solving Journey

### The Original Problem
The project faced significant **state synchronization issues** where:
- Multiple systems triggered spin states independently
- Race conditions between state updates caused phantom spins
- Complex debugging due to scattered state management
- Performance issues from unnecessary DOM re-renders

### The Array-Based Solution
The breakthrough came from rethinking the data structure:
1. **Identified Core Issue**: State synchronization complexity across components
2. **Chose Optimal Data Structure**: Arrays with index-based tracking
3. **Implemented Pre-allocation**: 100 symbol sets for infinite scroll behavior
4. **Created Debug System**: Real-time array visualization for development
5. **Simplified Architecture**: Single source of truth for reel states

### Key Results
- **60fps Animation**: Smooth scrolling without performance drops
- **Predictable Memory Usage**: No runtime allocation during gameplay
- **Simplified Debugging**: Clear visualization of system state
- **Eliminated Race Conditions**: Clean, predictable state updates

## 📊 Configuration Constants

```typescript
GAME_CONFIG = {
  reels: 3,
  symbolsPerReel: 20,
  visibleSymbols: 4,
  minBet: 1,
  maxBet: 100,
  payLines: [/* 5 pay lines with multipliers */]
}

TIMING_CONFIG = {
  SPIN_DURATION: 8000,      // Total spin duration (ms)
  REEL_START_DELAY: 500,    // Delay between reels starting
  REEL_STOP_DELAY: 500,     // Delay between reels stopping
  WIN_CHECK_DELAY: 100      // Delay before win calculation
}

INITIAL_BALANCE = 1000      // Starting player balance
```

## 🎯 Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- **TypeScript First**: Full type safety throughout the codebase
- **Component Composition**: Reusable, single-responsibility components
- **Reactive Programming**: Leverage Svelte's reactivity for clean data flow
- **Performance Conscious**: Always consider animation performance and memory usage

### Architecture Principles
- **Single Source of Truth**: Centralize state in stores, not components
- **Callback Props Communication**: Use function props for component interaction (Svelte 5 pattern)
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep animation, state, and UI logic separate
- **Debug-Friendly**: Include comprehensive logging and visualization tools

### Svelte 5 Migration
The project has been fully migrated to Svelte 5 patterns:
- **Replaced `createEventDispatcher`**: All custom component events now use callback props
- **Component Communication**: Parent components pass callback functions as props to children
- **Type Safety**: Callback props are fully typed with TypeScript interfaces
- **Standard DOM Events**: Native HTML events (`on:click`, `on:input`) remain unchanged
